## Quarto

# GAAAAHHHH!!!

-   WHY?!?!

-   This is quite frustrating!

-   I think I managed to fix it?

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a
finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that
includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed
code like this:

``` r
1 + 1
```

    [1] 2

You can add options to executable code like this

    [1] 4

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is
displayed)

``` r
3+5
```

    [1] 8
