## Question 1: Loading tidyverse

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

The tidyverse is loaded

## Question 2: Assigning values to "a" and "b"

```{r}
a <- 90
b <- 4
a <= b
```

a is not less than or equal to b

## Question 3: Using ls() function

```{r}
ls()
```

"a" and "b" are now listed in the global environment

## Question 4: Using rm(list = ls()) to clean up the environment

```{rm(list=ls())}

```

If you don't pass the "list" argument for the rm() function, it will default to the "..." argument, which is less specific.
